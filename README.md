## üöÄ Introduction

The Sorting Visualizer is a dynamic web application built to demonstrate classic sorting algorithms through smooth, real-time visualizations. Designed with both learners and tech enthusiasts in mind, it bridges the gap between theoretical computer science concepts and practical understanding.

Each sorting algorithm is implemented manually from scratch using TypeScript to provide complete transparency and reinforce algorithmic fundamentals. Additionally, the application displays the time and space complexities (Best, Average, and Worst case) of each algorithm to deepen the learning experience.
